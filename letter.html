<h1>Re: Eileen Dover applying to college</h1>
<p>
Dear Eileen,<br>
<br>

Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at Université Génialissime to<br> study
for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
</p>

 <h2>Start dates</h2>

</p>
 We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the<br> beginning of a semester;
the start dates for each semester are as follows:<br>
</p>

<ul>
   <li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li> 
   <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li> 
   <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li> 
    
</ul>
<p>
Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br>
</p>

<h2>Study subjects</h2>

<p>
In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall<br> within the field of science and technology.
 You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the<br> kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones<br>
that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:

</p>

<br><ol> 
<li> Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol <sup>(C14H12O3)</sup>.</li>
<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F),
   when the<br> audience size increases exponentially <sup> (effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</sup></li>
<li>Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the<br> 
research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.<br> 
</p>


<p>
Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,
<br>
